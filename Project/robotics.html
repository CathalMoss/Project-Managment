					<h4 class="card-title" style = "color:black;">Kengoro</h4>
					<p class="card-text" style = "color:black;">The most advanced humanoid robot to date has been developed by a team of researchers at the University of Tokyo. Named Kengoro, the robot has been made as similar to humans as current technology allows. Kengoro is the most advanced because he is the latest model, they have made two others previously. Standing 1.7 meters and weighing 56 kilograms, this robot is stuffed full of structural components, circuit boards, and more than 160 motors.Robotics is used for many different industries, taking over some of the more boring jobs such as painting cars and fitting parts. They are used in warehouses for shelf stacking and in jobs that involve the movement of goods to areas that could be unsafe for humans. Search and rescue is also another area robotics are being utilised.
					
					Mimicking human movements has been the aim of the researchers in Japan. Their successes with Kengoro include the ability to do push-ups, backbends, pull-ups, and can it hit a badminton birdy.It also appears to sweat. That is because the actuators used to pull the strings that mimic muscle movements get hot. To counteract this they ran tubes of water through the robot and added tiny holes as an outlet for the steam. With all the motors Kengoro has, there was no room for a cooling system, but this novel solution solved the problem that many humanoid robots encounter.

				<h4 class="card-title" style = "color:black;">Sophia</h4>
				<p class="card-text" style = "color:black;">Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia was activated on February 14th 2016 and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States. She is able to display more than 60 facial expressions.Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile interviews. In October 2017, Sophia became a Saudi Arabian citizen, the first robot to receive citizenship of any country.In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first ever Innovation Champion, and is the first non-human to be given any United Nation title.
				
				Cameras within Sophia's eyes combined with computer algorithms allow her to see. She can follow faces, sustain eye contact, and recognize individuals. She is able to process speech and have conversations using a natural language subsystem.Around January 2018, Sophia was upgraded with functional legs and the ability to walk.Sophia is conceptually similar to the computer program ELIZA, which was one of the first attempts at simulating a human conversation.The software has been programmed to give pre-written responses to specific questions or phrases, like a chatbot. These responses are used to create the illusion that the robot is able to understand conversation, including stock answers to questions like "Is the door open or shut?" The information is shared in a cloud network which allows input and responses to be analysed with blockchain technology.David Hanson has said that Sophia would ultimately be a good fit to serve in healthcare, customer service, therapy and education.Sophia runs on artificially intelligent software that is constantly being trained in the lab, so her conversations are likely to get faster, Sophia's expressions are likely to have fewer errors, and she should answer increasingly complex questions with more accuracy.She learned how to draw in 2019 for 7 months with collaboration with an artist who teaches AI to draw named Patrick Tressett. She drew a portrait of the Prime Minister of Malaysia on July 20, 2019 and drew a portrait of Holly Willoughby on This Morning with Phillip and Holly on November 21, 2019.

				<h4 class="card-title" style = "color:black;">Atlas</h4>
				<p class="card-text" style = "color:black;">
				Atlas is a bipedal humanoid robot primarily developed by the American robotics company Boston Dynamics with funding and oversight from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The 1.8-meter (6 ft) robot is designed for a variety of search and rescue tasks, and was unveiled to the public on July 11th 2013
				
				Atlas is based on Boston Dynamics' earlier PETMAN humanoid robot, has and is illuminated with blue LEDs.Atlas is equipped with two vision systems – a laser rangefinder and stereo cameras, both controlled by an off-board computer – and has hands with fine motor skill capabilities.Its limbs possess a total of 28 degrees of freedom.Atlas can navigate rough terrain and climb independently using its arms and legs, although the 2013 prototype version was tethered to an outside power supply.In October 2013 Boston Dynamics uploaded a video showing Atlas could withstand being hit by projectiles and balance on one leg.In 2014, Atlas robots programmed by six different teams competed in the DARPA Robotics Challenge to test the robot's ability to perform various tasks, including getting in and out of a vehicle and driving it, opening a door, and using a power tool. A variety of other robots also competed. The contest was inspired by the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and carries a USD 2 million prize for the winning team.In the 2015 DARPA robotics finals Atlas from IHMC Robotics (named Running Man) came second behind the Korean team Kaist and their robot DRC-Hubo by a margin of six minutes, completing the entire course in a time of 50:26.

				<h4 class="card-title" style = "color:black;">Spot Mini</h4>
				<p class="card-text" style = "color:black;">
				Spot is a compact, nimble four-legged robot that can trot around your office, home, or outdoors. It can map its environment, sense and avoid obstacles, climb stairs, and open doors.Given the small initial run of the robots, it seems like the SpotMini will carry a hefty price tag—think more like an industrial robot like Baxter, which costs $22,000. The robot’s main frame has a quick-disconnect battery, stereo cameras in the front, side cameras and a rear cam, but it can also be upgraded with a series of attachments on the top, including an articulated arm. SpotMini’s development is motivated by thinking about something that could go in an office or accessible place for businesses purposes, or a home eventually.Third-parties will be able to develop systems to mount to SpotMini for different applications. Currently, it has a surveillance package with special low-light cameras mounted on the back, there’s a camera mounted in the arm, and the computer can take user code.
